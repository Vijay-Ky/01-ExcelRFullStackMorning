| item_id | order_id | product_id | quantity |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| 101     | 1        | 1          | 5        |
| 102     | 1        | 2          | 3        |
| 103     | 2        | 1          | 2        |

Write a SQL query to retrieve the order date and the total quantity of items ordered for each order.

**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT o.order_date, SUM(oi.quantity) as total_quantity
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY o.order_date, o.order_id
ORDER BY o.order_id;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
| order_date  | total_quantity |
|-------------|----------------|
| 2023-09-15  | 8              |
| 2023-09-16  | 6              |
